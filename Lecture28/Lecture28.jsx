//REACT QUIZ
What is JSX in React?

a) A styling language for React components
b) A templating language that mixes JavaScript and HTML
c) A library for managing state in React
d) A framework for building user interfaces with React

Answer: (b) JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a templating language that allows writing HTML-like structures within JavaScript code.

Question 2:

What is the primary purpose of a React component?

a) To define a single page of a website
b) To encapsulate reusable UI elements with logic
c) To handle communication with external APIs
d) To manage user authentication for the application

Answer: (b) React components are the building blocks of user interfaces. They encapsulate UI elements and their associated logic, promoting reusability and maintainability.

Question 3:

How do you pass data between React components?

a) By directly modifying props within child components
b) By using global variables to store and access data
c) By passing data down from parent to child components as props
d) By lifting state up to the common ancestor component

Answer: (c)  Props (short for properties) are used to pass data down from parent components to child components. This promotes a one-way data flow.

Question 4:

What is the difference between state and props in React?

a) Both are used to manage data, but props are immutable while state can change.
b) Both are used for styling, but props are defined globally while state is specific to a component.
c) Both are for user interaction, but props handle events and state stores data.
d) There is no difference; they are interchangeable concepts.

Answer: (a) Props are passed down from parent components and are read-only within child components. State, on the other hand, is managed within a component and can be updated to reflect changes in the UI.

Question 5:

Which HTTP method is typically used to fetch data from an API in React?

a) PUT - To update existing data
b) POST - To create new data
c) GET - To retrieve data
d) All of the above can be used depending on the API endpoint

Answer: (c) The GET method is commonly used to retrieve data from an API in React applications.

Bonus Question:

What are some advantages of using React?

a) Improved performance and efficient rendering
b) Reusable components and clear separation of concerns
c) Declarative style for building user interfaces
d) All of the above

Answer: (d) React offers all these benefits. It promotes efficient rendering with virtual DOM, encourages code reusability with components, and uses a declarative approach for building UIs.
