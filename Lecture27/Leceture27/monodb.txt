What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (known as BSON, Binary JSON). This differs from traditional relational databases that store data in tables with a predefined schema.

Key Features of MongoDB:
Schemaless Design: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for flexible document structures within a collection.

High Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language supports complex queries, indexing, and aggregation operations to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently.

Document-Oriented: Data in MongoDB is stored in collections, which contain documents. A document is a set of key-value pairs and is analogous to a row in a relational database.

JSON/BSON Format: MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. This allows MongoDB to efficiently store and access data.

Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports replica sets for automatic failover and data redundancy, ensuring high availability of data.

Document-oriented: Stores data in flexible JSON-like documents (BSON) instead of rigid tables with predefined schemas. This makes it easier to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.

Schemaless design: Doesn't enforce a strict schema, allowing for flexible data structures within collections. This is good for evolving data models.

High scalability: Scales horizontally through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers. This makes it suitable for large datasets and high traffic applications.

Rich query language: Supports complex queries, indexing, and aggregation operations for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

Performance: Offers fast performance for reads and writes, making it ideal for real-time applications.

Replication and high availability: Supports replica sets for automatic failover and data redundancy, ensuring data is always accessible.

Use cases: Commonly used for e-commerce product information, real-time application data, content management systems, and big data applications.

Advantages over SQL databases: More flexible for unstructured or evolving data models.

Community and resources: Large and active developer community with extensive online resources like documentation, tutorials, and forums.
